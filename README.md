# reddit-script

This Python43 script parses the 'Hot' posts of the week and downloads the pictures from Imgur.

The script is meant to be used with subreddits such as EarthPorn, SpacePorn, FoodPorn, etc.

myconfig.py is used to determine the subreddits to check for pictures.

> the script will dump all the files in the parent directory for now, in the future it will create or save them on separate folders
